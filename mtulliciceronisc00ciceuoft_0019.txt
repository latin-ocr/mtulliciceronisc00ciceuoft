INTRODUCTION XV

‘ Catone Maiore ' satis multa diximus (de Off. 1, 151). Once
he refers to it as liber is . . . de senectute (a'e Div. 2, 3). It
seems evident‚ therefore, that the proper title is Cato Affaior.

With regard to the date of the Cato Maior two things can
be stated definitely. It was written before May 12, 13.c. 44,
for Cicero alludes to it in a letter to Atticus written on that
· day or the day before 3 it was written before the second book of
the de Divinatione, for it is mentioned in that book, and not
, ’ very long before, for it is spoken of as nuper interiectus. Book 2 .
of the de Divinatione, as is proved,.by internal evidence, was
written after the death of Julius Caesar (March 15, B.c. 44).
The Cato Maior, then, must have been written either shortly.
after or shortly before this date.

The arguments used in the discussion of this question must
be based on passages in the second book of the de Divina-
tione, the letters of Cicero, and the Cato Maior itself. The
, most convincing evidence to be found in these sources favors
ἴ the earlier date.

‚A eis em rebus quibas me ipsum interdum gravius
.  commoveri, quarum consolatio et maior est e‘t ΐνΐᾶᾖῖἳῖῖέἶφῇῑῖε“

fflicffibles of some kind existing at the time when the

Cato Maior was being written. These may be either the con-
ditions under Antony after Caesar’s death or the despotism
of Caesar in the months just preceding that event.

The fact that Cicero suggests writing a consolatio for these
‘ . troubles indicates the earlier date, as we know from his de
Divinatione (2, 6) that for this very state of things, a one-man
power, he had before the death of Caesar found consolation
in the political theories of certain Greek philosophers, while
in the period after Caesar’s death he was at first in a frame '
of mind rather suited to write a eulogy than a consolation,
later too dejected to recognize the possibility of a formal

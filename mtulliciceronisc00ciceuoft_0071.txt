’1 24 Appi Claudi: see Index of Persons. The incident here related 16
of him that when blind and old he had himself brought into the senate
in order to oppose negotiations with Pyrrhus, and to insist that there
should be no negotiations with a foreign enemy on the soil of Italy, is
the most illustrious in his life. The speech in which he enforced this
poliey was extant in the time of Cicer0‚ and passed as the earliest speei-
men of Roman prose literature. — accedebat: i.e. to the infirmity of age
was added the fact that (ut) he was blind. ’

7 26 faciendum: with both pacem and foedus.

7 27 persecutus est: ‘has given in full!

'I 29 viai: old form of the genitive, probably partitive with quo: ‘in
what direction.’

⁷ 30 enim: (and the rest Ι omit), ‘for,’ etc.

⁷ 31 et tamen: ‘and yet' you do not need to go even to the poem
(second-hand authority), ‘for the oration itself is extant? This succes-

which Cicero, whether purposely or not, adopts for the venerable Cato.

Cf. Cic. de Or. 3, 214: quae sic ab illo esse acta constabat, etc.

83 consulatum: his two consulships were in 13.c. 307 and 296. It
was very unusual for any but a consular to be made censor.

8 4 tamen: and yet calculation is useless, for tradition gives it thus
(sic), i.e. that he was old when he made the speech.

8 6 similesque sunt ut si qui . . . dicant: two constructions‚ eorum
similes sunt qui dicant and ut si qui dicant, are illogically combined, but 17
the thought is plain: ‘it is as if one should say,' etc.

8 8 foros: ‘the gangways,’ part of the deck.

8 10 facit: the subject is senectus (see above, 1. 6), or senex inferred
from it.

8 13 consilio: ‘advice.’—auctoritate: ‘influence.’—sententia: ‘offi-
cial opinion ' (in the senate). — quibus: with orbari as abl. of separation,
with augeri as abl. of specification.

8 14 Nisi forte: (as nisi vero) always ironical. ’ 18

8 15 miles, etc.: the regular grades of military service. The legatus
was often a man of consular rank.

8 18 praescribo: i.e. in virtue of his personal influence.——-Karthagini:
this was hardly a ground for boasting. With his characteristic narrow-
ness of spirit and selfish patriotism, Cato could not bear to see the

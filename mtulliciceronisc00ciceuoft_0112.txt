the name Cunctator. In his fifth consulship (B.c. 209) he recovered
Tarentum, the third city in Italy. The Roman commander, M. Livius
Macatus, had lost the city, but continued to hold the citadel, from
which he gave Fabius aid.

Fabricius Luscinus, C. (1 5, 43), a hero of the war with Pyrrhus, famous

with Socrates on the grounds of moral truth. The extreme Sophistic
principle he enunciated in this way: Nothing exists. If it did it couldn’t
be known; if it could be known it couldn’t be communicated. His last
words are said to have been “Now sleep bears me to his brother”

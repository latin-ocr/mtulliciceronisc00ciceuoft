88 ΟΝ OLD AGE

both these wars to an end, the first in 13.c. 290, the second by the battle
of Beneventum 13.C. 27 5. M’. Curius, C. Fabricius, and Ti. Coruncanius
are often mentioned together as types of the old Roman frugality and
integrity. For stories illustrating these qualities in Curius, see note

on .
{irtus (Maior) (30, 32, 79) established the great Persian empire by

first getting possession of the kingdom of Media, to which Persia was ·

then subject, and then conquering Lydia and Babylon. He died B.C. 529.

Cyrus (Minor) (59), son of Darius, younger brother of Artaxerxes 11,
to whom Darius had left the kingdom of Persia. With the assistance
of his mother, Parysatis, he tried to wrest the kingdom from Artaxerxes,
marching against him B.c. 401, with an auxiliary force of ten thousand
Greeks. He met his brother at Cunaxa, where he himself was killed,
but his Greek auxiliaries escaped and reached the coast in safety in
the famous retreat described by Xenophon in the A nabasis. Lysander,
a Spartan general in the Peloponnesian War, received financial aid
from Cyrus against the Athenians.

Decius Mus, Ρ. (75), a hero who sacrificed himself for his country in
the Latin War (B.c. 340-337). Livy (8, 9 ff.) tells us that the sacrifice
was preceded by a visit from an apparition which prophesied that on one
side a general, on the other side an army, must be sacrificed to the Manes
and to Mother Earth. Thus in sacrifieing himself Decius was also sac·
rificing the army of his foe and insuring victory to Rome.

Decius Mus, P. (43, 75), son of the foregoing. In his fourth consul-
ship (Rc. 295) was fought at Sentinum the decisive battle against the
great coalition of Italian nations headed by the Samnites (Third Sam-
nite War). His voluntary death (devotio; see note on 43) was followed
by a complete victory, which broke up the alliance, though the war
dragged on five years longer. Cicero (Tusc. 1, 89) says that a third
member of the family, grandson of the first Decius, sacrificed himself
in the same manner at the battle of Asculum in the war with Pyrrhus,
but elsewhere (de Offi 3, 16), he speaks of only two Decii, and the
existence of the third is not well authenticated.

Democritus (23), born about ΒΩ. 460 at Abdera in Thraee; said to
have lived about one hundred years. He is important as the first
philosopher who developed the atomic theory (originated by Leucip-
pus) which was afterward the basis of the philosophy of Epicurus.

Diogenes (2 3), of Babylonia, a Stoic philosopher (see Zeno), who came
to Rome from Athens 13.c. 155, on an embassy in regard to the settle—
ment of affairs after the Third Macedonian War. His companions were

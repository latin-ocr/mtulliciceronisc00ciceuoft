Roman Law, p. 3¹0. By the side of the jurists who had authority in
questions of civil law are mentioned the pontifices and augurs, who had
the superintendence of what we may call ecclesiastical law (for the ius
augurium, see note on 12, p. 6, 1. 6). The ius pontificium, exercised by
the college of pontifices, had authority in the entire field of religious
institutions, except so far as foreign rites were under the superintendence
of the quindecimviri sacris faciundis, who had charge of the Sibylline
Books. The Pontifex Maximus was therefore the head of the ecclesias-
tical institutions of Rome; this office was conferred upon Augustus, as
a regular part of the functions of the Emperor, who by this act became
head of Church as well as of State. This combination of supreme civil
and ecclesiastical powers continued until the Christian emperors.

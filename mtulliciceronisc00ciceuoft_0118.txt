universe. In connection with this last stood his famous theory of the
‘⁶ music of the spheres.''

Quinctius Cincinnatus, L. (56), a typical Roman patrician of the early
Republic. He was dictator twice. The famous incident of his being
called from the plow belongs to his first dictatorship, B-c. 458 (Livs
3, 26, 8 ff.); the second (B.c. 439), seditionis sedandae causa, was occa·

sioned by the uneasiness of the patricians at the popularity and ambi· ⁵

tion of Spurius Maelius. The only offense of Maelius, so far as was
proved, was that he lavished his wealth to relieve the poor in a time
of famine, This brought him into suspicion of scheming to make him-
self king, and rumor had it that he had filled. his house with arms and
held nightly meetings of conspirators (Liv. 4, 13). Cicero does not dis-
tinguish between the two dictatorships of Cincinnatus in the passage
in the Cato Maior where he mentions him.

Quinctius Flamininus, L. (42) (see Liv. 39, 42), known chiefly in con-
nection with his more famous brother (see below), under whom he
served as legatus in Greece.

Quinctius Flamininus, Τ. (1, 42), brother of the foregoing. He con·
quered Philip V of Macedon and ended the Third Macedonian War by
the‘battle of Cynoscephalae, B.c. 197 (Liv. 33, 24), thereby delivering
Greece for the time being from the increasing power of Macedonia.
Flamininus used his victory with great moderatiori. At the Isthmian
games, near Corinth, he formally restored their independence to the
Greeks, after which both Greece and Macedonia remained independent
for about fifty years. In B.c. 183 he was sent to Prusias, king of
Bithynia, to demand the surrender of Hannibal, who had taken refuge
there (Liv. 39, 51).

NOTES 55

12 7 prudentia: the knowledge of right living which made the atti-
tude of the men just mentioned different from that of Milo. Cicero,
de Fin. 5, 16, calls prudentia the ‘art of living.’ See also note on 1,
p. 1, 1. 1 1.

12 8 Orator: emphatic; ‘as to the orator,' etc. ' 28

12 10 Omnino: concessive ‘to be sure‚’ as in 45. For the affirmative
meaning, see 9, p. 4, 1. 2 5. — canorum: ‘ resonance.’

12 11 nescio quo pacto z nescio quo modo, ‘somehow’3 ᾖ 575, d;
B. 253, 63 G. 467, 2, 1 and N.; H. 651, 2.

12 12 Sed tamen: i.e. although the sonorous quality of the voice is
a-good thing, nevertlzeless another style of speaking is also pleasing in

‚ the old man, namely the quietus and remissus. Cicero says of Crassus

 

(de Or. 1 , 2 5 5); iam diu m ulto dicis remissius et lenius quam solebas ‚· neque
minus baec tamen tua gravissimi sermonis lenitas quam illa summa vis et
contentio probatur.

12 13 sermo: ‘style ’ς the word may refer to private conversation as
well as to public speaking. — remissus: ‘ unexcited.'

12 14 composita: ‘calm.' See App. This manner of speech is ap-
proved by Seneca (Ep. 40, 2)'for the philosopher and the old man:
philosopho, cuius pronuntiatio quoque, sicut vita, debet esse composita . . .
itaque oratio illa apud Homerum concitata . . . oratori data est: lenis et
melle dulcior seni profluit. -- mitis: ‘ gentle.’ — oratio: ⁴ oratory.'

12 15 Quam: commonly explained as referring to oratorical power
in general, oratio. The wh'ole expression oratio composita ac mitis, how·
ever, would be an appropriate antecedent. Cato’s oratory was of the
other type (cf. canorum above, l. 10, and magna voce et bonis lateribus, 14,
p. 7, l. 6), and in using the indefinite si nequeas he may very possibly have
himself in mind. Even if his own style is not the composita ac mitis, he
can advise a Scipio and a Laelius to cultivate such a style. Of them in
fact Cicero says (de Or. 1, 2 5 5): ut illum Scipionem audimus et Laelium,
qui omnia sermone conficerent paulo intentiore, numquam . . . lateribus aut
clamore contenderent. ,

12 18 doceat: ‘ teach‚’ in a general sense. —- instituat: ⁴ train.' 29

12 19 omne . . . munus: ‘the performance of every duty'; officium
and munus are here, however, practically synonymous. — instruat:
‘equip‚’ with the necessary powerS‚ information, etc.

12 23 bonarum artium: ‘liberal arts.'

12 24 quamvis: ‘ however much.'

12 28 Cyrus: in Xenophon's Cyropaedia, 8, 7, 6. — quidem: ‘for 30
instance!

brilliant commercial prosperity which Carthage continued to enjoy, even
after being humbled in the Second Punic War. He determined that it
should be not only humbled but destroyed, and for several years ended
every speech with the assertion that Carthage ought to be destroyed:
delendam esse Karthagmem . . . pronuntiabat. Flor. 1, 31, 4. Plutarch
(Cato 27) gives his habitual words as Δοκεῖ δέ μοι καὶ Καρχηδόνα μὴ εἶναι.

8 19 denuntio: ‘declare’; to ⁴ denounce’ (= declare) war is found in
archaie English, where the word is also used in the more general sense
of ‘threaten.‘ Cf. Milton, P. L. 9, 695:

Rather your deathless virtue, whom the pain

Of death denounced, whatever thing death be,
Deterred not from achievin g what might lead
To happier life.

19 8 21 Quam palmam: four years after the date of this dialogue Scipio
captured and destroyed Carthage.

8 22 avi reliquias: ‘what your grandfather left unfinished.' This
eulogy of the elder Scipio is quite unnatural on the part of Cato, who,
when quaestor under him, had conceived a hearty disapproval of him,
which lasted the rest of his life. See Plutarch, Cato. ’

8 23 sextus . . . et tricesimus: this would give us 13.c. 185, the date
implied by Livy, 39, 52, 1. The date of the death of the elder Afri-
canus is however given by Polybius (24, 8, 9) as B.c. 183, the same
year as that of Hannibal and Philopoemen, and this is the date usually

. accepted.

8 24 excipient: lit. ‘take up,’ one from another. —- ante me censorem:
Cato's censorship was B.c. 184, his consulship 1953 the interval here
given, novem annis, expresses the number of full years intervening.
Scipio’s second consulship was 13.c. 194.

8 26 creatus esset: see note on 16, p. 8, 1. 2, cum interfurit-sent.

8 28 paeniteret: the tense implies the thought ‘and were living now ’
in vixisset. —Necz notice the connectives: three divisions with nec, one
having a subordinate with aut, then three without connectives.

8 30 consilio, ratione, sententia: ‘advice, judgment, official opinion!

20 9 1 senatum: in its primary sense, a ‘body of elders,’ senes.—qui·
dem: ‘in fact) The Spartan senate (γερουσία) consisted of twenty-eight
men over sixty‚ and two kings. The small number enables Cicero to
call this a magistratus, which term he could not apply to the Roman-
senate.

9 6 cedo: ‘cornel’ or ‘tell us l ’ From do, an old imperative of dare,
and the demonstrative particle ce ⁴ here,' ‘ hither.'

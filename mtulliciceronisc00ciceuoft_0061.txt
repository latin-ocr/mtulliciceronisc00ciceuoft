NOTES 39

—et ferre et laturum esse: recalling iam urgentzs and certe adventantis,

l. 16.

1 19 mihi: not really emphatic, but opposed to te and tu according
to the Roman fashion (cf. Cic. pro Rosc. 1).

120 eo . . . quo: ‘such . . . as.’

1 21 uteretur: suij. of characteristic.

1 22 confectio: ‘composition.’

1 23 absterserit: Cicero admits to Atticus in one of his letters to
him (ad Att. 14, 21, 3) that old age is making him bitter‚ and that he
needs himself to take the medicine he has prescribed to others in his
essay: legendus milei saepius est ‘Cato Maior ' ad te missus‚· amariorem
enim me senectus facit. — mollem: ‘ undisturbed.’

22 cui: this relative introduces the causal subjunctive possit. Its
case is governed by pareat—pareat: suij. by attraction.—-tempus
aetatis: ‘period of life.’ The word aetas as found in the Cato Maior
admits of at least three translations: ‘life’ as a whole, as here; ‘ period
of lise,’ as in 4, p. 2, 1. 24; a special period of life, as ‘youth‚' in 45,
p. 19, l. 15; ‘old age,' in 39, p. 16, l. 25.

2 3 possit: causal suij. Its subject is is (antecedent of qui) under-
stood. cuz' qui pareat . . . possit is equivalent to cum is qui ei pareat . . .
possit—A good parallel for the construction is {ound in Cic. T use. 5,
45 : qualia {gitur ista bona sunt, quae qui babeat miserrimus esse possit ?

24 de ceteris . . . multa . . . hunc librum . . . de senectute: note 3
the elaborate efflamus—ceteris: other topics of philosophy (easily
inferred from the preceding sentence), not ‘other matters in general‚'
in which case rebus would be regularly employed. Cicero uses a similar
method of transition in Tusc. 4, 5: sed de ceteris studizls· alio loco et dice-
mus et saepe diximus. Here studiis is necessary to make the thought
clear.

2 5 misimus: epistolary perfect—autem: ‘however.’ The thought
is: ‘ I do not write it, however, as a treatise in my own person, but have
put it in the mouth of a fit speaker, not Tithonus, but,’ etc.

2 6 Tithono: an example os ‘⁴ immortal age '’ (see Index of Persons):

A white-hair’d shadow roamin g like a dream
The ever-silent spaces of the East.—- Tennyson, Tithonus.

2 7 Catoni seni: ‘Cato, an old man‚' or ‘the aged Cat0,' not neces-
sarily ‘ Cato the elder.' Cicero explains his reasons for making Cato the
spokesmzm, and uses the terms Cato Maior and Cato senex with clear
difference in meaning, Lael. 4: sed ut in ‘Catone Maz·0re,’ qui est scrzptus

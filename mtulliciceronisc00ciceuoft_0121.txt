Cyrus. He was the pupil of Socrates, and represents his master's views
in several works — the symposium, an account of an Athenian banquet,
where Socrates is made chief speaker, the Oeconomicus, a treatise on
the administration of the household and property in the form of a dia-
logue, where Socrates is again chief speaker, the Memorabilia, and the
Apology. He wrote also other works on various subjects, of no interest
in connection with the Cato Maior.

Zeno (23), of Citium, Cyprus (b. ca. B.c. 331, d. ca. B.c. 264), was the
founder of the Stoic philosophy, so called from the stoa or porch where
it was taught. He was a contemporary of Epicurus, and in theory dia-
metrically opposed to most of his views. According to the Stoic phi-
losophy, the primary substance was a fiery ether; from this the universe
had developed, and into this it would eventually be resolved, then re-
jormed, and so on periodically. Deity was immanent in the universe
and was identical with the fiery ether. The human soul was endowed
with a partial immortality. After the death of the body it would con-
tinue to exist until the next destruction of the universe. . . . The Stoic
ethics taught that virtue was the only good, that pleasure and pain were
alike indifferent, that the wise man was the good and therefore the
happy man, and all others were fools. This philosophy was introduced
at Rome comparatively early (see Intr. p. vii). Scipio and Laelius were
among its disciples, and Cicero reflects many of its views throughout
his philosophical writings.

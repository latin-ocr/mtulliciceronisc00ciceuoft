finem habet motus, vivendi finem habeat necesse est. Solum ιζξίίτιν, quod
se ipsum movet, quia numquam deserz'tur a se, numquam ne moveri
quidem desinit. Cf. also Cic. de Rep. 6, 27.

33 3 simplex: ‘ of one substance.'

33 6 magnoque esse argumento, etc.: magno . . . argumento, pred.
dat. of purpose. The subiect of esse is the clause quod . . . arripiant.
Homines scire, etc., states the fact that the argument goes to prove.
The general sense of the passage is: the fact that children learn so
quickly that they seem to be merely recalling things already familiar to
them, implies that the soul existed previous to its connection with its
present body, and in that period acquired the knowledge that it now
reealls. And this previous existence implies a future existence. The
argument is found in Plato, Phaedo 72 (Jowett): “Your doctrine,
Socrates, that knowledge is simply recollection, if true, also implies a ·
previous time in which we learn that which we now recollect. But this
would be impossible unless our soul was in some place before existing
in the human form. Here then is another argument for the soul’s
immortality . . . (77), for if the soul existed before birth, — and in being
born can be born only from death, — must she not after death continue
to exist, since she has to be born again? '’

33 10 reminisci: ‘call to mind.’—recordari: ‘dwell upon,’ in thought.
—ferez implying, as is the ease, that not all of the foregoing arguments
are from Plato.

'79 33 11 Cyrus . . . dicit: Cyrus the Elder, founder of the Persian em-
pire, in the Cyropaedia of Xenophon, 8, 7, 17-22. The expression is
somewhat changed in passing through the lips of Cato, but the general
thought is the same. In the Cyropaedia Cyrus has stated his desire that
the elder son should rule after him, but should, if he need a colleague,
associate the younger with him in the government. He urges his
sons to honor one another, and thus show their regard for him after
his death.

33 14 Nec enim: here Cyrus begins a series of five arguments to
prove the soul's immortality ι (ι) (a negative argument) the soul’s invisi-
bility after the death of the body does not prove that it too dies, for it
is invisible even when in the body; (2) (nec vero, 80, 1. 17) the dead still
influence the living, (3) (mihi, l. 20) it is unreasonable to suppose that
the soul derives life or consciousness from its connection with the per·
ishable and unconscious body; (4) (atque etiam, 1. 25) of all the com-
ponent parts of man, the soul alone cannot be traced in dissoluti0n3
(5) (iam vero, 81, 1. 29) the soul shows its independence of the body by

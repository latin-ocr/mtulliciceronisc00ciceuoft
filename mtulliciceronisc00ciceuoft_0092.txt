24 16 cultum . . . deorum: the first fruits of the season were offered to
the gods as described by Tibullus (1, 1, 13) in his eulogy of country life:

Et quodcumque mihi donum novus educat annus,
Libatum agricolae ponitur ante deo.

24 17 iu gratiam . . . redeamus: ‘be reconciled with! A concession
to offset the extreme stand taken against pleasure before (39—42).

24 19 cella: the general word for ‘store-room.' As wine was in
common use, and oil took the place of butter, the cella vinaria and
the cella olearia were of special importance, while the cella penaria was
the general store—room for other sorts of provisions.

24 22 conditiora: fowling and hunting give a spice to these regular
and necessary occupations. Preserve the emphasis by using the passive:
⁴ these are made more palatable by,’ ete.

24 23 aucupium: {roni avis and capio.

57 2425 specie: ‘sightliness.'

24 30 melius: than in the country.—aut: this indicates the mutual
exclusion of the two clauses it connects, while vel, ve, within the clauses,
connect actions at least compatible with each omen—aquis: probably
streams are meant. — refrigerari: ⁴ refresh itself.’

58 24 31 habeant . . . relinquant: observe the chiastic arrangement:

25 1 clavam: ‘single-stick,' ‘foil.‘-pi1am: ‘ball.’ References to
games of ball are common in ancient literature from the Odyssey down.
Among the Romans trtgon seems to have been the favorite. This was
played by three persons, standing at the apices of an equilateral triangle,
and throwing the ball from one to another. No bat was used.

25 2 talos: a kind of dice or knuckle-bones, rounded on two sides,
flat and marked on the other four. Four at a time were used. Another
kind, unmarked, were tossed in the air and caught on the back of the
hand, just as boys do now. Of these five were used.

25 3 tesseras: ‘ dice ’ς inscribed with numbers on all six sides. Three
at a time were used—id ipsum: ‘ and that t00.’—utrum(= utrumcumque)
lubebit: ⁴ as (whichever) they like!

59 25 5 Xenophontis libri: three small treatises on husbandry, horse-
manship, and hunting (with hounds).

25 8 Oeconomicus: including husbandry or the general management
of an estate.

25 11 regem: ‘ prince,‘ belonging to the royal family. Cyrus was
never king, but was killed in the attempt to get the kingdom away
from his brother.

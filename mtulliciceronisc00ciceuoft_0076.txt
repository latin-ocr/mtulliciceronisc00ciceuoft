54 ON om) AGE

11 14 cuiusque: referring to the senes implied in the abstract senectus
above.

11 15 Quid: ‘how is it with?’ see note on 22, p. 9, 1. 23.—addiecuut:
‘learn something new.’ He has spoken of those who continue in old
age the pursuits they carried on when young, tale scilicet, etc„ but some
even go so far as to begin new pursuits. ’

11 17 et ego feci = et ut egoseci.

11 18 litteras Graecas: ‘ Greek literature’3 cf. Cic. Ac. Pr. 2, 5: cum
Graecas litardus M. Catonem in senectute didicisse acceperim. See note
on 3, p. 2, l. 12. — sic avide: both these words modify arripui, and sic
is explained by quasi. Cf. 12, p. 6, l. 8, ita . . . quasi.

11 19 ut . . . essent: purpose clause— Cato’s reason for reading
Greek.

11 21 Quod: i.e. acquiring new knowledge in old age.

11 22 vellem: potentia] suij. referring to the past, ‘ Ι should have
wished,‘ etc. §447, ις 442, b; G. 2 58; H. 5 56.—-discebant: the fact that
Socrates learned to play the lyre in old age gave Cato the desire to do
the same, while the ancient Romans themselves afforded precedents suffi-
cient to justify him and save his sels-respect. The clause discebant . . .
antiqui seems like an after· -thought on the part of Cicero, on realizing
that Cato would hardly have taken Socrates as a model.

11 23 fidibus: abl. of means (sc. canere), but tr. ‘learn the lyre) —
certe. i. e if not in music, at any rate in literature.

27 11 24 desidero: ‘feel the want of.’

11 25 locus: in its technical rhetorical sense locus may mean (ι) an
argument of a general nature, such as may be used in various specific
cases (locus communis), or (2) the headings under which certain arguments
are grouped; i.e. the place where they are to be found. Here it has the
latter meaning, recalling the four general headings in the indictment
against old age (1 5), among which diminution of strength was the second.

11 27 Quod est . . . agere pro viribus: i.e. use the strength you have,
but proportion your activity to this strength, so as not to feel aggrieved,
as Milo did, if you cannot carry this activity beyond a certain point.

11 28 vox: ‘words.’ — contemptior: more despicable.’

12 1 At: those athletes' muscles are strong, ‘but these muscles of
mine,’ etc.

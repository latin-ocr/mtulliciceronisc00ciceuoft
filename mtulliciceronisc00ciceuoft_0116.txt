94 ON OLD AGE

When the enchantress Medea returned with Jason to Iolcos, she per-
suaded the daughters of Pelias to cut up their father and boil him in a
caldron in order to make him young again, having first done the same
herself with Aeson, the father of Jason. She took pains, however, that
the enchantment should fail with them, and thus avenged her husband
upon his enemy.

Philippus, see Marcius.

Pisistratus (72), a younger relative of Solon, whose constitution he
overthrew ΒΩ. 560, making himself the first tyrant of Athens (see Solon).
He is said, however, to have made friends again with Solon after his
usurpation‚ and to have often asked his advice (see Plut. Solon, 31).
He died 13.c. 527.

Plato (13, 2 3, 41, 44, 78), founder of the school of philosophy known
from its place of meeting (the grove of Academus) as the Academy.
He was born 13.c. 427, died B.c. 347. His home was Athens, but he
traveled much, visiting among other places Egypt, Sicily, and Magna
Graecia, where he gave attention to the Pythagorean philosophy. At
Athens he was a pupil of Socrates. He believed that virtue was the
summum bonum and that wisdom was the means of its attainment. His
most famous doctrine is that of the “ idea,” What we perceive through
the senses is not the real, but only various manifestations of the real
that lies back of these manifestations in the realm of pure mind. These
intangible realities he calls ‘⁴ ideas.” They are the ‘⁴ concepts ” of logie.
Thus “ Man ” is the ‘⁴ idea,” of which individual men are only so many
shadows as it were. The senses recognize men, the mind alone Man.
This belief served as the basis for his Pythagorean belief in the trans·
migration of souls. The soul has existed always and has known these
“ideas” through all the stages of its existence. Thus all that we call
knowledge is in reality reminiscence or recollection of this previously-
possessed knowledge. A necessary corollary to this existence of the
soul before the birth of the present body is its existence after the death

,of the body.

Plautus, see Maccius.

Pomponius Atticus, T. (1), a rich Roman banker, publisher, and writer,
Cicero's most intimate friend. His sister Pomponia married Cicero's
brother Quintus. Atticus acquired his cognomen from the fact that he
spent much of his time in Athens. He was on intimate terms with
various other politica! men at Rome, as well as with Cicero, but kept
himself resolutely out of politics. Both the Cato Maior and the Laelius
de Amicitia are dedicated to him.

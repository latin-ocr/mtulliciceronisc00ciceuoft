66 ΟΝ OLD AGE

Andronicus adapted from the Greek a tragedy and a comedy to be
produced at the Ludi Romani of this year.

21 12 processit aetate: ‘lived’

21 14 P. Scipionis: not the young Scipio (Aemilianus) present, but
his second cousin, P. Scipio Nasica Corculum (see Index of Persons,
genealogical table of the Scipios). — his paucis diebus: ‘a few days ago?

21 16 senes: pred. noum—vero: ‘then again.’—cethegum: Cethegus
died B.C. 196.

21 17 Suadae medullam: quoted as from the ninth book of Ennius’
Annales by Cicero, Brut. 58.

21 19 ludorum: this term may include all the spectacles of the Roman
festival, dramatic performances as well as athletic contests and gladia-
torial shows, and this is probably the sense in which Cicero uses it here,
though doubtless he had the less intellectual parts of the festival par·
ticularly in mind. The writing of plays he has just counted among the
legitimate if somewhat trivial (leviora) occupations of old age.

21 22 pariter: ‘in even pace! — honestum: ‘ an honor to him.’

21 23 illud . . . quod ait: ‘ that famous saying,’ explained by senescere
se, etc.

51 21 26 Venio nunc, ete.: having dealt with the pleasures of the senses ⁷
and with the higher pleasures of the intellect, the writer next takes up.
those of a sort less generally appreciated‚ but particularly appropriate
to the character of the old censor. Plutarch says that Cato in his old
age engaged in farming for amusement. There is nothing, however, in
the extant works of Cato to show that this pleasure in agriculture was
more than that of eaming an honest living, and such expressions as
incredibiliter delector, terrae . . . natura delectat, probably have no founda-
tion in fact. See the Introduction to his de Agri Cultura, quoted p. xvii.

21 29 Habent . . . rationemt (a mercantile phrase) ‘deal’ (lit. ‘keep
a debit-and-credit account ’).

21 30 recusat imperium: probably also mercantile, ‘dishonor one’s
draft.' .

22 1 faenore: this word is used in the same way by Columella, 10, 142: · ’
ut redeant nobis cumulato faenore messes.-—non fruetus modo: (referring
to the preceding faenore) i.e., that is not all, but the growth is as pleas-
ant as the profit.

22 2 Quae . . . aristarum: this whole passage is full of the technical
terms of husbandry.

22 3 subacto: ‘ subdued ' or ‘well-filled!

22 4 occaecatum: ⁶ hid ' or ‘ imprisoned.’ — occatio: really from occa,
‘harrow ’ (the etymology is absurd).

60 ΟΝ OLD AGE

16 25 aetatis: ‘age,’ standing here, asin English, for old age. Rarely,
as in 45, it may mean youth. See note on 2, p. 2, 1. 2. —- ei quidem: ‘if
really,' nearly equivalent to ⁴ since.'

1627 orationem: ‘discourse’ '

16 28 tradita: ‘ reported! ⁴

16 30 capitaliorem: involving the head (caput), therefore the life, .

‘ deadly.’

17 1 ecfrenato: from ex and frenum, ‘bridle.'

40 17 2 Hinc: a corporis voluptate. Reid refers in explanation of this
passage to Lecky, sztory of E uropean Morals, vol. ΙΙ, p. 21 1, N. : “vice
predisposes men to unpatriotic acts whereby the supremacy of the State,
the most cherished ideal of the Romans, would be impaired.” It may
well be that Cicero here has in mind the concrete case of the conspiracy
of Catiline. The character of Catiline and his followers he has painted

· (in Cat. 2, 5, ιο), as that of corrupt pleasure-seekers, while the dealings
with the Allobroges (in Cat. 3, 2, 4 ff.)‚ were an example of cum hostibus
clandestina colloquia. — proditiones: ‘ acts of treason ’ (a common Latin
use of the plural).

17 4 scelus: a more abstract term than facinus. —— facinus: in
Cicero's time facinus appears to have been used mostly in a bad
sense, but this was not so originally, and hence it is here qualified
with malum.

17 6 stupra vero: ‘ and as to debaucheries,' etc.

17 7 excitari: ‘stirred up.’

17 8 sive natura eive quie deus: (cf. Cic. Ac. Pr. 2, 61) to the Stoics
the popular gods merely symbolized different manifestatione of one
divine power immanent in and guiding the universe; to the Epicureans
they were beings careless of man's affairs and of the world, while Nature
was the active power at work in the universe. By the philosophers of
the New Academy, all assertion was based on probability, and conclu-
sions were reduced to a sive . . . sive.

17 9 muneri: ‘function ’ (if given by Nature). —dono: ‘ gift ’ (if be·
stowed by divine power).

41 17 13 fingere animo: ‘imagine.’—-iubebat . . . censebat: observe the
partial return to the direct narrative.

17 14 percipi: (reaped) ‘ experienced,’ cf. 33, p. 14, l. 14.

17 16 nihil agitare: ‘ pursue no subject.’—nihil . . . consequi: ‘estab-
lish nothing by argument or reflection.’

17 17 Quocirca: resumes as a conclusion the first statement, nullam
(esse) etc„ in the indirect form, whence the subj unctives esset, exstingueret.

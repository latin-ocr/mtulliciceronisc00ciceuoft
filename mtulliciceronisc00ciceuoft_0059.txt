CHAP. 1, 1—3. Cicero sets forth to his friend Atticus his motive in composing the
work.

II, 4-6. Scipio and Laelius ask of Cato his experience of old age.

II I, 7-9. Cato recounts the charges commonly made against old age, and qualifies them.

IV; V; 10-15. He speaks of the old age of Fabius Maximus, employed in politics
and war, and of other examples, both Greek and Roman, philosophers and poets. There
are four complaints against old age ε exclusion from active life, the enfeebling of the bod-

XVII, 59-61. Xenophon, Cyrus, Valerius, and others.

XVIII, 62-65. But only a well-spent youth can prepare for an honorable age: the
unhappiness of age is the fault of temper in the old. ¹

XIX, δί’-7 1 . The approach of death: comparison of exposure to death in age and youth.

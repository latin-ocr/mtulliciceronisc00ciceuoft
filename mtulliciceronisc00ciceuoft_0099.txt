NOTES 77

32 10 compagibus: ‘structure‚’ ‘penthouse.’—munere . . . perfun-
gimur: ‘we are fulfilling (as it were) a task of necessity and a burden-
some work? Cf. Cic. de Rep. 6, 15: (the soul must not leave the body
without the command of Providence)‚ ne munus humanum adsignatum
a deo defugisse videamini.

32 13 quasi demersus: the literal meaning of demersus is appropriate
to the sea rather than to the earth.

32 17 modo: cf. the meaning of moderationem, 1, p. 1, 1. 9.

32 18 ratio ac disputatio: ‘theory and argument?

32 21 incolas paene nostros: because the chief seat of the Pythago· 78
reans was Croton, a Greek city of southern Italy.

32 22 quin . . . haberemus: ‘that we have souls drawn (as drops from
a fountain) from the universal divine intelligence.’

32 23 mente divina: this theory of a world-soul, however, was not
peculiar to the Pythagoreans. It was a doctrine of Plato and of the

Stoics as well.
32 24 Socrates: in Plato’s celebrated dialogue, the Phaeda

32 25 disseruisset: suij. in implied indir. disc.; §592, 2; B. 323;
G. 663, 2; H. 649, 1.
32 26 sapientissimus:

Whom, well-inspired, the oracle pronounced
Wisest of men. — Milton, Paradise Regained, 4, 275.

32 27 Sic mihi persuasi: ,four proofs of the immortality of the soul
follow: (1) its great eapacity; (2) its innate power of motion; (3) its
homogeneity of substance 3 (4) its pre—existence.

32 28 celeritas: ‘ rapidity of thought.'

32 29 prudentia: ‘foresight‚’ the original meaning of the word. See
note on 1, p. 1, 1. 11. —tantae scientiae: scientia means not ‘science‚’
but ‘knowledge‚’ and can no more properly be used in the plural than
can that English word. It is found in classical Latin only here (see
Moore ad loc.) and must be translated ‘branches of knowledge’ or
‘range of knowledge.’

32 31 semper agitetur: ‘is always in motion! The same argument
(from Plato’s Phaedrus, 245 c) is quoted more fully by Cicero in Tusc.
1, 53. The argument there is, ‘Unceasing motion means unceasing
existence; existence ceases when motion ceases. Therefore, only that
in which the source of motion never fails, i.e. that which is its own
source of motion, is eternal: quod semper movetur aeternum est‚· quod
autem motum adfert alicui, quodque ipsum agitatur aliunde, quando

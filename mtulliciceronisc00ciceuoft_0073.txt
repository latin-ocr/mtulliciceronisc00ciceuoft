9 7 Ludo: the meaning is doubtful. It may be ‘the Lydian,' as The
Etruscan (the Etruscans traditionally traced their origin to Lydia), in
which case the play was a praetexta. See Index of Perseus—Naevius.

9 9 Ptoveniebant: an agricultural word. A crop of them were spring-
ing up.—stu1ti adulescentuli: an instance of similar disaster from a
similar cause is given in 1 Kings 12, 8, where King Rehoboam “for-
sook the counsel of th‘e old men which they had given him, and took
counsel with the young men that were grown up with him.''

9 12 At memoria: objection; i.e. memory is lost, which is needed for 21
active business. — nisi . . . exerceas: general condition; see note on 9,
p. 4, 1. 27, vixerit. , λ

9 13 Themistocles, etc.: Themistocles’ memory is said to have been
so good that it was a burden to him, and he wished he might learn
to forget. Cf. Cic. Ac. Pr. 2, 2: qni quidem etiam pollicenti cuidam se
artem ei memoriae, quae tum primum proferebatur, traditurum, ¹respon-
disse dicitur ‘ oblzw'sci se malle discere,’ credo, quod haerebant in memoria
quaecumque et audierat et viderat.

9 15 qui Aristides esset = the accusative Aristidem (which would be
ambiguous): ‘ that he ever saluted Aristides as Lysimachus.'

9 16 Equidem: ⁴ for my part.‘

9 18 sepulcra legens: Cato was writing his history, the Orzgv'nes. —
quod aiunt: ‘as they say.’ This expression points to a proverb. The
same whim has prevailed in modern times.

v 9 22 vadimonia constituta: ‘recognizances given,’ hence ‘acting as
bail,‘ a very common occurrence with men of property, for in all per-
sonal actions the defendant gave bail to appear. ’

9 23 Quid: an ellipsis of tibi videntur, faciunt, or agunt is commonly, 22
but probably without necessity, assumed here. Quid often appears to be
used quite independently, merely to effect a rhetorical transition, like age. -
It may be translated ‘how is it with? ‘ Cf. 26, p. 1 1, 1. 15.—iuris consulti:
these were persons who made jurisprudence a study, and whose formally
expressed opinions had much the same weight that judicial decisions
have at the present day (see Maine’s A ncient Lazo, ch. 2, p. 42). They
were consulted by private persons to ascertain and secure their rights,
by advocates, jurors (iudices), and even by the praetors, who, though their
duties were judicial, were themselves rarely lawyers, but politicians in
the regular career of office. Until the Empire, jurists' decisions had no
binding force, but only a moral influence. Augustus gave to some jurists
the ius respondendi, the right to interpret the law with binding force ; see

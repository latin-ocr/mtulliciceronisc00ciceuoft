INTRODUCTION xiii

eloquence, the energetiC, upright young rustic became known
to the patrician Lucius Valerius Flaccus, who was his fast
friend in Rome and afterwards his colleague as consul, legatuS,
and censor. With all his intellectual vigor he had the preju-
dices of the narrow and bigoted conservatism that marked the
temper of the older Republic 3 and it was one of his acts to
expel the Athenian envoys mentioned above from Rome, for
fear of their corrupting the Roman youth. His son Marcus,
who died ΒΕ. 15 2, —a man of marked genius and merit, —mar-
ried the daughter of Aemilius Paulus, and so was brother-in-
law of the younger Scipio. Another son, born when Cato was
eighty years old, was the grandfather of Cato Uticensis, the
most able and honest of Caesar's enemies. After a long con-
troversy with Scipio Nasica, Cato succeeded (B.c. 150) in
bringing on the third and last war with Carthage. He died
the following year, at the age of eighty-five.

Cato is best known by the severity with which he exercised
the censorship. This gave him the name by which he is best
known, Censorius, or the censor. This office was then at the
height of its efficiency, -and was an engine of almost despotic
power. The men holding it had the unrestricted right to make
out the list of Senators, that is, to determine who should govern
Rome for the next five years ; and, on the other hand, to punish,
by expulsion from the Senate‚ by a private stigma of infamy,
or even by the entire deprivation of political rights, any per-
son whom they chose (see 42). A cause must be assigned 3
but even if this were omitted, there seems to have been no
appeal from their judgment. Flaccus, the colleague of Cat0‚
stood steadily by him in his action as censor, and, with his
narrowness, obstinacy, prejudice, but entire honesty, Cato exer-
cised the power of his office with relentless vigor. If it was
especially his own private enemies that he punished‚ no doubt
he sincerely believed them to be dangerous to the State, or
they would not have been enemies of his.

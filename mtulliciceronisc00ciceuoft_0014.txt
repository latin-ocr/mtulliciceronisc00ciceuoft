x ΟΝ OLD AGE

The memory of his griefs he sought to banish by spending
whole days in composition. To this period belong, among
other philosophical writings, the Academica, the de Finibus,
the Tusculanae Disputationes, the de Natura Deorum, and
with little doubt the Cato Maior (de Senectute). The death
of Caesar, with the new political hopes it brought, broke off
these labors for a while 3 but before the final struggle with
Antony began there was another short interval of literary
activity, in which were composed the treatises de Divinatione,
de Fato, de Gloria, de Officiis, and Laelius (de Amicitia).

Probably no one of his shorter writings is better known or
more generally admired than the dialogue on Old Age. It ’
was written at the age of sixty-two years and upwards, and was
addressed to his friend Atticus, who was three years older.1 It
belongs to the division of Ethics, which had for its subject-
matter the nature of the summum bonum and the conduct of
life. Since the third century B.c. philosophy had lost the hope
of substituting reason for violence in the management of affairs,
and had aimed to find for the individual philosopher, in virtue
or pleasure or elsewhere, a satisfaction to outweigh the inevi-
table ills of life. Every relation and incident of life was a sub-
ject of philosophical discussion, either from the pleasure it
could afford, or the pain it was commonly supposed to cause.

In this treatise Cicero endeavors to show that old age, usually
considered one of the ills of life, is to the wise man deprived
of its terrors. He alludes (3) to a work on old age by Aristo
of CeOS, but neither that work nor any one Greek work can
be assigned with any degree of certainty as a prototype of the
Cato Maior.²

2 Theophrastus and Demetrius of Phalerum (not named in the Cato
alaier) are said to have written on old age, and in the Cato Maior
Cicero mentions many other Greek writers, and quotes largely from
Plato and Xenophon.

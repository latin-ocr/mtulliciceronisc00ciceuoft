86 ON 'o'LD AGE

in his time. Mommsen says of him, “the history of Rome presents vari-
ous men of greater genius than Scipio Aemilianus, but none equaling
him in moral purity, in the utter absence of politica] selfishness‚ in gen-
erous love of his country, and none, perhaps, to whom destiny has
assigned a more tragic part.” He died B.c. 129, and there was strong
suspicion that he was assassinateu by the infamous Carbo. He is im-
portant not only as a statesman, but also as a patron of literature. The ’
group of literary men of which he was the 'center is known as the
‘⁶ Scipionic circle.” Among them were Laelius and Terence. They were
greatly interested in Greek literature and philosophy, and did all in
their power to encourage interest in these at Rome. They stood, thus,
for precisely the ideas that Cato opposed, and there is no record of
such intimacy between Scipio and Cato as is implied by Cicero.

cornelius Scipio Africanus Maior, P. (19, 29, 35, 61, 82), son of Pub-
lius Scipio, cos. B.c. 205 and 194. He first won glory by saving his
father’s life in the battle of the Ticinus. He fought in the battle of
Cannae (216), carried the war into Africa in 204 (with Cato as quaestor),
where he won his decisive victory over Hannibal at Zama in B.c. 202.
He then took part in the war against Antiochus, as legatus with his
brother, L. Cornelius Scipio Asiaticus. He withdrew from public life
after this campaign, because he and his brother were accused of misap-
propriating the spoils of the war, and retired to his country home near
N aples, where he died, probably in B.C. 183. See note on 19, sextus.

Cornelius Scipio Africanus, P. (35), son of the foregoing, a man known
to fame only as the son of his father and as the father of his (adopted) '
son, Scipio Aemilianus Africanus Minor. His epitaph is still extant. See
note on 35, si ita.

cornelius Scipio Nasica Corculum, P. (50), grandson of Gnaeus Cor·
nelius Scipio, received the name Corculum (from cor) for his intel-
lectual eminence. He married Cornelia, the daughter of the elder
Africanus. He opposed Cato’s constant demand for the destruction of
Carthage (Liv. Epit. 48), and advocated its preservation as a check
upon the vainglory of the Roman people (Plut. Cat. 27).

coruncanius, Ti. (ι 5, 27, 43), a native of Tusculum, the first plebeian
pontifex maximus (Liv. Epit. 18).

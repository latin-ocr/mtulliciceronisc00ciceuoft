orations contain many indications. He had at various times
in his life come in contact with Greek representatives os all
the important schools of philosophy. In his early youth he
had studied with the Epicurean PhaedruS, and at first was
largely influenced by the teachings of that school. Later he
studied logie under the Stoic Diodotus, and lastly he im-

B.C. 88. From 79 to 77 he lived at Athens and Rhodes, where
he again came strongly under Academic and Stoic influences.
Besides devoting himself so extensively to the definite study
of Greek philosophy under these instructors, Cicero gave much
time throughout his life, particularly in his periods of enforced
leisure from political activity‚ to the reading of philosophy.
From the time of his acquaintance with Philo he classed him-
self with the New Academics‚ but he was in reality'an eclectio,
choosing from each system what seemed good to him. In par-

He early formed the design of setting forth in Latin the
whole body of philosophy, a design which he may be said in
the main to have accomplished.1 He had, however, for the
minute metaphysical speculations of Greek philosophy little
taste. In this he was at one with most of his countrymen, and
for their satisfaction and his own he studied and reproduced
in his philosophical works mainly the practical ethics of his
masters. He nowhere lays claim to originality, even along
these lines. From the Greeks he adopts and adapts what suits
him, sets it forth in choice Latin enriched and made luminous

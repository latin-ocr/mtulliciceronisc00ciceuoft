44 oN ου) AGE

B.c. 204) agrees with the rule that ten years of service (or at least of
presenting one’s self for conscription) was necessary before holding any
civil office.

5 8 quintoque anno post: i.e. counting in the fifth year, B.c. 209.

5 9 quadriennio post: i.e. after the expiration of the full four years'
interval, B.c. 204.

5 11 cum quidem: ‘at which very time.’ Cato has now traced his
acquaintance with Fabius to the time when he was really admodum
grandzs natu. The whole of this prelude, suited to the garrulousness
of age, indicates also the respective dates of these lives—legis Cinciae:
(B.c. 204) ordaining ue quis· ob causam orandam pecuniam donumve acci—
peret. This was one of a series of laws designed to shut out the gov-
erning aristocracy from active business. The idea seems to have been
similar to that which requires members of the British Parliament to
serve without compensation; government was the business of a rich
hereditary aristocracy.

5 12 ut'adulescens: thus a match for Hannibal, who was really young
(iuveniliter exsultantem ) .

5 13 plane grandis: not so strong as admodum grandin—iuveniliter
exsultantem: ‘in the vigor and pride of his youth! ’

5 14 patientia: ⁴ stubborn resistance.’ —molliebatt ⁴ held in check.’

5 15 familiaris: rather an unwarranted term under the circumstances.
Towards the end of his life Cato modified his stern conservatism so far
as to make a study of Greek literature (see 3); but at the time alluded

to he was the last man in Rome to make an ‘intimate ’ of a mere man ’

of letters, of Greek birth too, like Ennius. Indeed, he reproached M.
Fulvius Nobilior, a leader in the Hellenizing movement of the day,
for having taken Ennius with him on his campaign in Aetolia. In sup-
port of Cicero's representation here, however, it should be noticed that
Cato was responsible for Ennius’ first going to Rome (see Index of Per-
sons— Ennius), and that Cato’s deeds were glorified by Ennius in his
Annales.

5 16 Unus, ete: quoted from the Annales of Ennius. The same lines
are again quoted by Cicero, de Off 1, 84, and (the first verse) ad Att. 2,
19, 2. Vergil adapts the first line, A. 6, 845:

tu Maximus ille es,
unus qui nobis cunctando restituis rem.

-cunctandoe hence his cognomen, Cunctator.
5 17 Noenum: a negative particle found chiefly in early Latin.— ι

rumores: the talk of the people against him accusing him of cowardice

new elubs. By the expression habui semper sodalis Cato probably means

19 13 Magnae Matris: i.e. Cybele, a goddess of nature, worshiped
with wild rites on Mt. Ida and in other parts of Asia Minor. The
Romans found in the Sibylline Books, during the war with Hannibal,
a prophecy that a foreign enemy would be expelled from Italy when
the Idaean mother should come from Pessinus to Rome. An embassy
was accordingly sent to King Attalus of Pergamus, who actually gave
into their possession the meteoric stone which was the fetish of this
worship. The oracle prescribed that it should be received by the man
qui vir optimus Romae esset, and the Senate fixed upon the young
Publius Scipio Nasica, son of Gnaeus (see 29, p. 12, 1. 20). From this
time the worship of the Great Mother was one of the most popular of
the religions of Rome; it was celebrated in the Megalesia, April 4-10,
with processions, beating of drums, and dramatic exhibitions. It was at
this festival, in the years between 166 and 161 B.c., that four of Terence's
plays were first produced, the Andria, Hecyra, Heauton Tz'morumenos,
and Eunuchus.

fire and sword.’

NOTES 53

10 16 numquam fere: ‘hardly ever.'
10 17 serendis, ete.: abl. of respect.
10 18 condendis: i.e. curing and storing.

10 22 Serit arbores: quoted again by Cicero in Tusc. 1, 31. Vergil
expresses the same sentiment, Ecl. 9, 50:

Insere, Daphni, piros‚· carpent tua poma nepotes ,·

and Emerson, ‘⁴ Essay on Manners’': “ Even the line of heroes is not
extinct. There is still ever. . . some friend of Poland; some Philhellene;
some fanatic who plants shade trees for the second and third genera-
ti0n‚ and orchards when he is grown old”; and of these “ fanatics ” was
Tennyson, who planted a pine in Aldworth garden the day that he was
eighty (Memoz‘rs, vol. 2, p. 359). For the meter, bacchiac tetrameter, see
5628, b; G. 812; H. 721, 2, N. 1.

10 23 Statius: Caecilius Statius. See Index of Persons. — Nec 25
vero, ete.: ‘and in fact the farmer never hesitates.’

10 27 melius: i.e. in the preceding. Supply dicit. The three quota-
tions from Caecilius form an anticlimax so far as Cato’s approval of
them is concerned.

10 28 illud: ‘ the following '; the usual meaning of illud in introducing
quotations. Cf. Cic. T usc. 1, 107 : illud vero perquam inane.-

neque sepulcrum quo recipiat, habeat portum corporis, etc.

10 29 nil quicquam: this combination belongs to early and late Latin.
Cf. Terence, Plzorm. 80:

noster mali nil quicquam primo,

10 31 videt: the subject is indefinite, ‘ one sees.'

11 2 Illud vero . . . vitiosius: ‘ and this still worse.’

11 5 eumpse: old acc. of ipse (is-pse). —alterit supply aetati from
the preceding aetate. The discussion of the relations between these two
periods of life, old age and youth, is continued in the following passage.

11 9 coluntur et diliguntur: the former implies outward marks of 26
respect, the latter the feeling. —adulescentes . . . gaudentt perhaps a
delicate compliment to Atticus is here intended. The intimate friend-
ship between him, an old man, and the young Brutus is alluded to
by Nepos, Att. 8: sic M. Bruto usus est, ut nullo ille adulescens aequali
familiarius quam hoc sene.

11 12 ut . . . sit: indir. question.

11 13 agens . . . et moliens: these words are often coupled. Agere
is the more general word. Moliri implies productive activity.

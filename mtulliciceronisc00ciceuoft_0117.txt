INDEX OF PERSONS 95

Pontius Herennius, C. (41), a Samnite, father of the general who
fought at the battle of the Caudine Forks in the Second Samnite War‚
B.c. 321. Pontius was the noble Samnite who gave the wise advice that
unless the Roman army at the Caudine Forks should be massacred to
a man, it should be released without dishonorable conditions. The
neglect of this counsel‚ with the infamous duplicity of the Romans, cost
the life of his gallant state (Liv. 9, 3).

Pontius Telesinus, C. (41), son of the foregoing, general of the Sam-
nites in the battle of the Caudine F orks. He refused the advice of his
father, subjected the Romans to the deepest humiliation possible by
sending them under the yoke, then forced upon them unsatisfactory

terms of peace, and allowed them to go home. The senate refused to ,

accept the tenns of peace (Liv. 9, 4 ff). Pontius was afterwards captured,
and executed at Rome. ¹ ,

Pontius, Τ. (33), a centurion. His identity is not known, but Lu-

Pyrrhus (16, 43, 55), king of Epirus, summoned by the Greek city of
Tarentum B.c. 281 to help it in its struggle with Rome. After several
victories (Heraclea 280, Asculum 279), he was finally defeated by the
Romans at Beneventum, B.c. 275.

Pythagoras (23, 33, 73, 78), a Greek philosopher born at Samos,
flourished in the second half of the sixth century B.C. He left Samos
to escape the tyranny of Polycrates, and settled at Croton, a Greek
city of southern Italy, where he gathered about him a band of young

men whom he formed into a sort of religious brotherhood. This was Δ

finally broken up on account of political difficulties. Asceticism was

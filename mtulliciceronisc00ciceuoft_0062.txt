ad te de senectute, Catonem induxi senem disputantem, quia nulla vide--
batur aptior persona quae de illa aetate loqueretur quam eius qui et diu-
tissime senex suisset et in ipsa senectute praeter ceteros floruisset, etc. ·

2 8 Apud quem: ‘ at whose house.'

2 9 Laelium et Scipionem: these two names are types of friendship
like Damon and Pythias, or David and Jonathan. Cicero’s treatise on
F riendship, de Amicitia, the 'companion to the de Senectute, has its name
from Laelius, as the latter from Cato, and in one of his letters (ad Fam.
5, 7, 3) he jestingly expresses the hope that the same relations may exist
between himself and Por'npey, as those between Laelius and Scipio: ut
tibi multo maioriquam Africanus fuit, . . . me, non multo minorem quam
Laelium, facile et in republica et in amicitia adiunctum esse patiare.

2 11 ipse: as opposed to the part he plays in this book.

2 12 attribuito: ‘you must ascribe it.’ For the use of the future im-
perative, especially common in apodoses and in familiar language, see
§4493 B. 281, 1, a; G. 268, 2.-litteris Graecis . . . in senectute: this
statement is at least greatly overdrawn. On the other hand, the com-
mon story that Cato did not learn the Greek language till he was an old
man is probably untrue, as is indicated by ‘various incidents recorded of
his life.

2 14 plura: sc. dicere. —Iamz ⁴ presently.‘

4 2 16 Saepe numero: ‘ ostentimes,' lit. ‘ often by count?

2 17 excellentem: as compared with others.

2 18 perfectam: ‘absolute.’—quod . . ‚senserim informal indir.disc.
following admirari.

2 20 Aetna: a proverbial expression from Euripides (Herc. Fur. 637),
referring to the myth of Enceladus buried beneath Mt. Etna. Cf. Long-
fellow's Enceladus:

Under Mount Etna he lies,
It is slumber‚ it is not death, etc.

2 22 haud eane: ⁴ not very.’ A kind of litotes, always with a jocose
turn, as our ‘⁴ not much of,’' etc.

2 24 omnis aetas: equivalent to omne tempus aetatis in 2, p. 2, l. 2.

2 25 omnia bona . . . adferat: these Stoic sentiments are put naturally
in the mouth of Cato, to whose character the doctrine had a special fit-
ness. Yet his native austerity did not make Cato a disciple of the Stoic
system of philosophy, like Scipio and Laelius, and in urging the expul-
sion of the three Greek philosophers from Rome in 155 B.c., he made
no exception in favor of the Stoic Diogenes.

NOTES 41

2 30 putavissent: suij. of indir. disc. (for indic. of direct, which the
Latin prefers in these expressions, e.g. putaveram, where we say “should
have thought ’').

2 31 Qui: ‘ how '; an old ablative fossilized as an adverb—adules-
centiae senectus, etc: cf. on 2, p. 1, 1. 17, senectutis. In the present pas-
sage Cicero makes adulescentia cover also iuventus, and senectus cover
the aetas seniorum.

3 3 Praeterita: very emphatic by its position.— quamvis: ‘ however ’;
the word modifies longa—cum effluxisset: i.e. in the case supposed.
For cum clauses equivalent to conditions see ἓ 542; G. 583.

3 6 quae utinam . . . esset: ‘and I wish it were.' 5

3 7 cognomine: i.e. the title sapiens bestowed on him.-—in hoc . . .
sapientes: ‘a philosopher,' alluding to the Stoic doctrine: secundum
naturam vivere.

3 10 descriptae: describere here is used like scribere. It more com-
monly means either to ‘transcribe' or to ‘describe’ See App. —ex-
tremum actum: i.e. life is a drama and its author, Nature, will not leave
its last act void of interest. —inerti: ‘without skill’ (ars).

3 11 tamen: ‘yet,’ however excellent the composition, it must have .
a beginning, middle, and end—aliquid extremum: aliquid is used as a
substantive, modified first by extremum and then by vietum and caducum.

3 12 bacis: meaning the smaller fruits‚ as olives, etc.

3 13 maturitate tempestiva: ‘in the fullness of time?

314 quod: ‘and this state of things.'—-molliter: ‘patiently’; lit.
‘smoothly ' or ‘without resistance '; also used in a bad sense, ‘effemi-
nately.’—Quid est, etc.: the sense is that fighting against the plans of
nature, of which old age is a part, is just as foolish and hopeless as
fighting against the gods, as the giants did.

3 15 Gigantum: a brood of monsters who revolted against Zeus and
were punished by being thrust under the earth, Enceladus, for instance,
under Mt. Etna (see note on 4, p. 2, 1. 20, Aetna). They were often con-
founded with the Titans, an earlier race of demigods, children of Uranus -
and Gaea.

3 16 Atqui: regularly used of the minor premise; ‘and now‘ (that 6
being so).—ut . . . pollicear: the clause is parenthetic; translate by an
infinitive; ἐξ 532, 5333 B. 282, 4; G. 545, R. 33 H. 568, 4.

3 18 fieri: belonging grammatically to the last verb, volumus. Spera-
mus would take a future infinitive.

3 19 quibus . . . rationibus: by what means. —ingravescentem aeta-
tem: ‘the increasing burden of age.'

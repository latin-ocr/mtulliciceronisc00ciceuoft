whose time sixty of his orations were extant, admired his style -and'
based his own largely upon it.

Junius Brutus, L. (75), the leader in the revolution which expelled .
the Tarquins from Rome B.c. 509.

Laelius, C. (77), cos. B.c. 190, father of the interlocutor in the Cato
Maior, a friend of the elder Scipio, as his son was of the younger.

Laelius Sapiens, c., b. B.c. 190, cos. 140, interlocutor in the Cato Maior.
He was in his time a man of high culture and considerable influence,
especially noted as a public speaker. To us he is important chiefly
through his association with Scipio, to whose “circle ” he belonged.

Laertes (54), father of Odysseus.

Lepidus, see Aemilius.

Licinius Crassus Dives, P. (27, 50, 61), an eminent jurist, pontifex
maximus, cos. B.c. 205. He took part in the war against Hannibal.

Livius Andronicus (50), the earliest figure (excepting Appius Claudius)
in the history of Roman literature. He was a Greek by birth (of Taren·
tum), was brought to Rome prisoner, and there, B.c. 240, exhibited a
comedy and a tragedy, the first Latin plays, adapted firom the Greek.
He also translated the Odyssey into Latin Saturnian verse. His work is
important rather for the impulse it gave than for its own merits. He
lived ca. B.c. 284-204. ,

Livius Salinator, C. (7), cos. B.c. 188. His most important achieve-
ment was his naval victory when in command of the fleet against
Antiochus, B.c. 191.

Livius Salinator, Μ. (1 ι), a distinguished and successful general in the
campaign against Hasdrubal 13.c. 207, erroneously represented by Cicero
as in command at Tarentum. It was in reality Marcus Livius macutus
that lost Tarentum and gave efficient service from the citadel in its
recovery. . For explanation of Cicero’s error, see Α. J. P. XIX, 437
(1898).

Lysander (59, 63), a distinguished Spartan general, who defeated the
Athenians at Aegospotami, ΒΩ. 404. He used against Athens the aid
and treasure of Cyrus.

Lysimachus (21), father of Aristides.

Maccius Plautus, T. (50), born ca. B.e. 254, at Sarsina in Umbria,
died 184. He translated from the Greek (very freely) the comedies of
Menander, Philemon, and others. Twenty of these are extant (including
both of those mentioned in the Cato Maior), and form the earliest com-
plete specimens of Roman literature now existing. In spite of their
Greek origin they have a strongly Roman flavor.

13.c. 218, crossed the Alps into Italy, and made his way gradually south·
ward, constantly victorious. After his victory at Lake Trasimenus
(B.c. 217), Quintus Fabius Maximus was made dictator, and it was at
this time that Cato entered upon his military career (Cat. Mai. 10; 18).
In 216 Hannibal won his great victory at Cannae, and occupied Capua.
In 215 Syracuse went over to his side, and in 212 Tarentum came into
his power. The Romans soon recovered these places, Syracuse under
Marcellus B.c. 212, Capua and Tarentum 21 1 and 209 respectively‚ under
Fabius Maximus. In all these campaigns Cato is said to have taken
part, though the tradition according to which he was military tribune
under Marcellus at Syracuse (Nep. Cat. 1, 2) is probably false. He was
also present at the battle of the Metaurus (B.c. 207), the first decisive
victory of the Romans, under Livius Salinator and Claudius Nero. In
203 Hannibal returned to Africa. Scipio Africanus had carried the war
thither the year before, and under him Cato acted as quaestor. In
202 came the final victory of Scipio at Zama. Carthage later turned
against Hannibal, and he spent his last days in exile, first at the court
of Antiochus of 'Asia, then at that of Prusias of Bithynia. While living
with Antiochus he helped him in the plans for his war against Rome
(B.c. 192-190)‚ the war in which Cato ended his military career under
Glabrio (battle of Thermopylae, 191). Hannibal ended his life at the
court of Prusias, B.c. 183, by taking poison to escape being surrendered
to the Romans, who had sent an embassy under Titus Quinctius
Flamininus (q.v.) to bring him to Rome.

Hesiodus (23, 54), Greek poet of the eighth century 13.c. His native
town was Ascra in Boeotia. His works were the Τ lzeogony (probably), a
mythological poem, and the Works and Days, a sort of farmer's calen-
dar, mingling directions for farming with general reflections and stories.
It is to the latter work that Cicero refers in the Cato Maior.

Homerus (23, 31, 54), accepted generally, though not universally in
antiquity, as the author of the Iliad and the Odyssey. He was gener—
ally reckoned as the earliest known Greek poet, though some would
have given that honor to Hesiod (see note on 54 multis . . . saeculis).
Seven cities claimed Homer as their son,

Smyrna, Chios, Colophon, Salamis, Rhodos, Argos, Athenae.

Isocrates (13, 23), the “old man eloquent,” who, at the age of ninety-
three, died at the report of “ that dishonest victory at Chaeronea, fatal
to liberty ’⁹ (Milton, Sonnet 10). He was a pupil of Gorgias of Leon-
tini, and himself the head of a school of rhetoric at Athens. Cicero, in

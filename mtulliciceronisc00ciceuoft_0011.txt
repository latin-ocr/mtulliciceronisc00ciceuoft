Greek philosophy, at its beginning, six centuries before our
era, had consisted in fanciful speculations upon the'source and
origin of the universe. But by the time of Cicero it had come
to embrace all human knowledge and to be the substance of
all liberal education. It consisted of three divisions,——natural
philosophy, ethics, and dialectics, of which the second was
regarded as the most important. The writings of the early
Roman poets‚ beginning with Ennius, abound in ideas taken
from Greek philosophy, but this learning was first formally in-
troduced among the Romans in 15 5 B.c., when Carneades the.
Academician, Critolaus the Peripatetic, and Diogenes the Stoic,
the most famous philosophers of their time, came on an em-
bassy from Athens to Rome and discoursed upon their respec-
tive doctrines. Their learning and eloquence captivated the
young nobles, especially Scipio and Laelius, who are intro-
duced in the following treatise. The Stoic Panaetius also,
about the same time, was welcomed in Rome by Scipio.

From this time on, all young Romans of distinction were
instructed in the new education, and Stoic philosophy in
particular became very popular. The first, however, to com-
mit their views to writing (with the exception of the poets
already mentioned) were certain Epicureans.1 In Cicero's time
this same school is represented by Lucretius with his de Rerum
Natura, one of the greatest poems in Latin literature. The
other schools, though they won ardent adherents in Rome,
seem to have found no one to represent them in literature
before Cicero himself. Cicero had been carefully educated in

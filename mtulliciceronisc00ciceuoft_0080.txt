58 oN OLD AGE

15 2 ni ita fuisset: Cicero has in mind perhaps the still extant
epitaph of this “ mute inglorious ” Scipio:

mors perfecit tua ut essent omnia brevia,

honos, sama, virtusque, gloria atque ingenium:
quibus sei in longa licuiset tibe utier vita,
facile facteis superases gloriam maiorum, etc.

—illudz referring to Africanus, but attracted to the neuter gender by
lumen which is predicate to it. λ

15 8 pugnandum: Cicero elsewhere, as well as here, is decided in his
advocacy of activity in old age. Cf. de Off 1, 123: nihil autem magis
cavendum est senectuti quam ne'languori se desidiaeque dedat.

36 15 9 habenda ratio: ‘ regard must be had‚’ lit. ‘account must be taken,’
a business term.

15 10 tantum: (only) ‘so much.’

15 13 tamquam: ‘ as it were!

15 14 corpora: translate by the singular with the definite article,
according to the English idiom in such generalizations. -quidemz ‘it
is true.'

15 16 ait = dm't. — quos ait . . . hos significat credulos, etc.: the verb
is used with two accusatives like verbs of naming. ‘For by those whom
he speaks of as the foolish old men of comedy‚ Caecilius means the

credulous, the forgetful, and the careless.’ To circumvent the old man ’

was the chief aim of the young man and the slave in Roman comedy.

15 19 petulantia: ‘wantonness.’

15 21 non proborum: stronger than improborum.

15 22 deliratio: ‘dotage.’ Originally a figure from plowing. Deliro
means literally to go out of the furrow (lira = ‘ ridge ’); figurafively, then,
it means to leave the straight path of sense. Cf. the somewhat similar
figure in the lines quoted from Ennius in 16. — levium: ‘frivolous.’

37 15 23 robustos: ‘grown up’; i.·e. with the strength, robur, of man-
hood.

15 24 regebat: used appropriately of the absolute power (patria po-
testas) exercised over his family by the Roman father in early times. So
long as his father lived, no Roman could be legally independent, unless
emancipated by his father.

15 27 auctoritatem: moral authority <such as exists nowadays).—
imperium: power of command, including power of life and death (im-
plied in the patria potestas); see note on 64, p. 27, l. 17.

15 28 metuebant servi, etc.: note the emphatic position of the verbs.

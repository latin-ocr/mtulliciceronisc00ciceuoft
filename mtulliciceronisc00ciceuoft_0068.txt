6 1 fili . . . consularis: this son, who had the same name as his father,
was consul 13.c. 213. It is of him that the story is told, strongly charac-
teristic of Roman customs, that his father, being sent as legatus to his
camp, and meeting him as he proceeded with his train of lictors,
neglected to alight from his horse, as respect for the consul required.
Upon this a lictor, at the son’s order, commanded him to dismount.
He sprang at once to his feet, with the words, “I wished to see, my
son, how well you knew that you were consul ’' (Liv. 24, 44).—Est in
manibus laudatio: ‘ his eulogy is extant,' ‘ at hand.’

6 2 quem philosophum, etc.: i.e. a nobler temper than any philosopher.

6 3 in luce . . . in oculis civium: the second expression merely inten-
sifies the first: ‘in the light of publicity and before the public gaze!

6 4 intus domique: contrasted respectively with in luce and in oculis
civium: ‘in the obscurity of private life and the society of his intimate
friends.' .

6 6 iuris augurii: i.e. the ecclesiastical or canon law of the Romans.
It was characteristic of both Greeks and Romans, and one of the chief
sources of their enduring freedom, that they had no priestly class, but
that the religion of the State and the political administration of the
State were in the same hands. A few priestly offices of low grade were
held as professions by men of low rank3 a few priesthoods of great dig-
nity but of no political influence, such as that of rex sacrificulus, flamen,
the Salii, etc., were held for life by men of rank, selected solely for their
patrician birth3 but the great colleges of pontffices, augures, etc., which
had control of the religious institutions in their relation to the govern-
ment, were invariably made up of leading statesmen. For example,
Cicero was augur, Caesar was pontifex. From this it resulted that the
interests of a priesthood were never, as in Egypt and other eastern
countries, suffered to interfere with the interests of the State. The ius
augurium was the code of rules by which the college of augurs inter·
preted the auspices, or expressed will of the gods. —Multae . . . ut in
homine Romano litterae: ⁴ a good knowledge of literature, for a Roman.'
Cicero admits elsewhere also the superiority of the Greeks over ,the
Romans in these matters: doctrina Graecia nos et omni litterarum genere
superabat.— T usc. 1, 3.

6 7 domestica . . . externat ‘Roman . . . foreign! More often domes-
tica bella are civil wars, externa bella wars waged by Rome against foreign

nations.
Β 8 ita: in correlation with quasi. Cf. 26, p. 11, l. 18, sic . . . quasi.

6 11 Quorsus: ‘to what end.’

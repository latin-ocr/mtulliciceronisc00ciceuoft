80, ΟΝ OLD AGE

35 4 Peliam: Cicero should here have named Aeson rather than
Pelias, as Medea’s magic rites were successful in the case of the former,
while she purposely caused the experiment to fail with the latter, her
husband's enemy, and he died. For the story see Index of Persons,
Pelias.

35 5 repuerascam: this word (lit. = ‘to become a child again ') is
used in a modified sense, ‘to behave like a child,’ Cic. de Or. 2, 22,
and Plautus, Merc. 296.

35 7 calce: ‘ the goal,’ anciently marked with lime or chalk (calx).

84 35 9 habeat ι sc. commodi.—sane: ‘if you will! Lucretius (3, 934)
makes the same point, comparing life to a feast:

. . . quid mortem congemis ac fles?

nam gratis anteacta fuit tibi vita priorque

et non omnia pertusum congesta quasi in vas
commoda perfluxere atque ingrata interiere:
cur non ut plenus vitae conviva recedis

aequo animoque Lapis securam, stulte, quietem?

35 15 devorsorium: ‘an inn ’ (for turning aside from the highway).
“ But while we deal with this as a finality‚ early hints are given that we
are not to stay here; that we must be making ready to go: a warning
that this magnificent hotel and conveniency that we call Nature is not
final.'' — Emerson, Poetry and Imagination.

35 18 conluvione: ‘confused medley'; ‘muddless

35 19 Catonem meum: his son.

35 22 quod contra: ‘whereas on the contrary.' Quod is governed by
contra, an unusual word-order. Cf. quem contra, Cic. Phil. 2, 18.

35 23 respectans: ‘ looking back toward?

35 25 non quo: ‘not that.' —aequot ‘untroubled.’

35 26 ferrem: suij. in a reason expressed merely to deny it; ᾖ 540,
Ν. 33 B. 286, 1, b; G. 541, Ν. 23 H. 588, 11, 2.

35 27 digressum: walking in different patha—discessum: ‘separa-
tion,' from one another.

85 35 31 qui . . . credam: suij. of characteristic, ‘in thinking.'—libenter
erro: ‘ 1 am glad to err.‘

36 2 minuti: ‘petty.' Cicero has in mind the Epicureans, who be-
lieved not in immortal life, but in “immortal death,” mors inmortalis
(Lucr. 3, 869).

36 3 nihil sentiam: ‘ have no consciousness.’

36 7 peractio: ‘closing act ’ (cf. the figure in 5, p. 3, l. 10). The word
occurs nowhere else in classical Latin.

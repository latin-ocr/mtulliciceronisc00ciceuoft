64 ON OLD AGE

imus. Three guests, summus, medius, imus, reclined at each table. The
conversation began a summo, that is at the extreme left, and was
passed along from one to the other. The place of honor was the low-
est at the middle table—adhibetur in poculo: ‘is carried on as the
cup goes round.’

20 4 Symposio: ‘the Banquet.‘ One of Xenophon's works in which .
Socrates is introduced.

20 5 rorantia: ‘drunk by sips.’ The whole expression minuta atque
rorantia is a translation of Xenophon’s own words: μικραῖς κύλιξι . . .
ἐπιψακάζωσιν.-τοίῐὶὲεταῒίο . . . ignis hibernus: as this whole passage
deals with the banquet, it is probable that these expressions refer to the
temperature of the dining-room. Wealthy Romans often had two dining·
rooms, one for summer and one for winter use. Cf. Juv. 7, 183: surgat
et algentem rapiat cenatio solem.

206 ignis hibernus: ‘the winter fire.’ —in Sabinis: ‘on my Sabine
estate!

20 7 compleo: ‘make up ' (the conventional number for a banquet).
The question of number was important at a Roman banquet, as the
largest number that could be comfortably accommodated at a table
was nine. According to Cicero's contemporary, Varro (see Aul. Gell.
13, 11, 2), the number should be “not less than the Graces nor more
than the Muses.’'—vicinorum: depends on convivium.

but (it may be said), even if you, an old man, do find pleasure in feast·
ing, the pleasure is less keen than it would be in youth. Cato himself
admits this in the credo which follows, and also in the words omniafiunt
in dies mitiora, 45, p. 19, 1. 15.

20 13 adfecto aetate: ‘stricken in years.'—utereturne‚ etc.: ‘enjoyed
the pleasures of love? ‚ ,
. 20 14 Di meliora: supply duint, the old form of dent. The expression
is equivalent to ⁴ God forbid!

20 18 non caret: Cicero (Tusc. 1, 88) defines carere in the words egere
eo quod habere velis. Inest enim velle in carendo.

20 19 hoc non desiderare: the infinitive is used substantively, with hoc
in agreement. Cf. Cic. de Fin. 2, 18: lzoc non dolere.

48 20 20 bona aetas: i.e. youth.

20 21 ut diximus: in the discussion on feasting and love, 44-47.

20 24 prima . . . ultima: front and back row. —eavea2 the part of
the theater occupied by the spectators, consisting of concentric rows of
seats rising one above another, whence the name. The first complete

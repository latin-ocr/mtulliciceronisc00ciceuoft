Composita; compta: there is so much uncertainty in the MSS.
that the question of usage and meaning is here of especial importance
as a ground of decision. Compta has better MS. authority than com:
posita, and is often used of oratory. But its meaning, ‘polished,’
‘elaborate' (it is used by Quintilian, 10, 1,79, to describe the style
of Isocrates), is not at all what is wanted in the present passage.

What is wanted here is a word which may be paired as a syn-
onym with mitis, as quietus above is with remissus. Moreover it
should be a word that will apply to delivery as well as to the writ-
ten style, as that is the thing especially under discussion. Composi-
tus is used in exactly the sense desired by Seneca (Ep. 40, 2):
pronuntiatio, sicut vita, debet esse composita, etc. (see note on text) 3
and it is used in contrast to concitatus and actually as a synonym
for mitis by Quintilian (6, 2, 9): acffectus {gitur hos concitatos, illos
mites atque compositos esse dixerunt. (Cf. also Quint. 11, 3, 1 10:
composita actio).

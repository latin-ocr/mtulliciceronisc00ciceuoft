INTRODUCTION iX

by numerous illustrations drawn from Roman history and poli-
tics, and thus gives a new lease of life and a wider sphere of
usefulness to the loftiest thoughts and noblest ideals of his pred-
ecessors. In this lies the value of his philosophical writings to
his countrymen and to the world.

The circumstances which led Cicero to devofe himself,
especially in his later years, to philosophy were both personal
and political. At an earlier period, when, after his return from
exile, he was politically in the background‚ he had written the
de Republica and begun the de Legibus,—showing by the very
titles of these works that his interest in philosophy was largely
that of the statesman. But in the later period (47—43) the
situation was more complicated and the influence of circum-
stances turned his interest along other and more purely philo-
sophical lines.

During the first year of Caesar's supremacy (13.c. 46> we are
told that he gathered a sort of school about him in his retreat
at Tusculum, where “he trained Pansa, Hirtius, and Dolabella
like a precept0r‚'' seeking distraction from the defeats and
calamities of his public life.1 The death of his daughter Tullia,
early in the following year, with other and more ignoble domes-
tic sorrows, confirmed his disposition to solitude, and his desire
to find comfort in “the calm and still air of delightful studies.’'2

1 “While I languished in idleness‚ and the condition of the State was
such that it must needs be ruled by one man's counsel and care, Ι
thought, first, that philosophy should be unfolded to our people for the
sake of the State itself‚ holding it to be of great consequence to the
honor and glory of the body politic (civitas) that things so noble and
weighty should be had in Latin writings. I was urged to this, besides,
by that sorrow of heart, caused by the great and heavy blows of fortune
for which, if I could have found any greater comfort, I should not have
taken refuge primarily in this; but in no way can Ι better share that
comfort than by giving myself not only to the reading of books, but to
the handling of philosophy at large.''—]V. D. 1, 7.

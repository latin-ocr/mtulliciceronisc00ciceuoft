42 ON OLD AGE

3 21 vero: ‘ of course.’

8 23 Volumus sane: stronger than Cato’s gratum futurum est; ‘vs-hy,
certainly we are anxious?

3 24 longam . . . viam, etc.: the same idea is expressed by Plato, Rep.,
328 E. — confeceris: the tense, as regularly after tamquam, tametsi, etc„
follows the rules of sequence, not of conditional clauses; § 524, N. 25
B. 307, 23 G. 602; H. 584.

3 25 ingrediendum: neuter (impersonal) gerundive, governing the
accusative, quam; § 500, 3, ex. 4 and 5³ G. 427, N. 2; H. 621, 3. (In
Greek this usage is regularly retained with the verbal τέον and in San-
skrit it is universal. An archaism in Latin, perhaps here used inten-
tionally as such.) —qualez i.e. ‘what is the nature of.’

7 3 27 aequalium (i.e. in age): ‘ mates,’ explaining pares, below. —pares,
etc.: a proverb. Cf. Plato, Rep. 329 Α (Jowett): “Old men flock together,
they are birds of a feather, as the proverb says.’' Much of what follows
here is translated almost literally from the same part of the Republic.—-
autem: used in its weakest sense ε ‘ for, you know.'

3 29 quae . . . quae: cognate acc., referring by synesis (agreement in
sense instead of form), to querellis, 1. 27.

330 tum. . .tum: now...n0w.

3 31 carerent . . . spernerentur: suij. because the blame is stated as
that of the old men, not of the writer.

4 3 usu venirent: usu is probably abl. of means.

4 4 quorum . . . multorum: emphasis is here placed upon the differ·
enee between these old men and others, and the first genitive should be
regarded as dependent on the second, not as in agreement with it.

4 5 sine querella: equivalent to an adjective; ‘ uncomplaining.’

4 8 moribus: ‘ character,’ as determined by habit. —Moderath ‘ well·
regulated.' These and the following adjectives apply to qualities of
character either natural or developed, not to purely intellectual qualities.

4 9 difficiles: ‘hard to please ' (of the temper). Horace uses the same

‚ adjective of the senex, A. P. 173.—inhumani: ‘churlish' (of breeding
merely). Horace, Ep. 2, 2, 211, asks as one of his test questions:
lenior ac melior fis accedente senecta ?

and Cicero admits to Atticus that he feels the evil effects of old age
upon his disposition. See note on 2, p. 1, l. 23.
,4 10 autem: ‘on the other hand.’
8 413 opes et copias: of these opes is the more general word, including
immaterial as well as material resources, while copias implies only the
latter. — dignitatem ι ‘positiom’

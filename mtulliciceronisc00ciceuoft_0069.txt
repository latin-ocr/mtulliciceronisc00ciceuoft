NOTES 47

6 14 pedestris: the term ‘infantry’ is often applied in Greek and
Latin to the whole land force as distinct from the marine.

6 16 quiete et pure atque eleganter: the et joins two ideas, the second
of which contains two subdivisions: ‘quietly and with uprightness and
refinement.’ ’

6 18 scribens: according to one tradition, Plato actually died pen in
hand. Α

6 19 Panathenaicus: this was a eulogy of Athens.

6 21 vixitque: que here has an adversative force.

625 quod: cognate acc.

· 626 Sua . . . vitia . . . conferunt: ‘charge their own failings upon.’ 14

630 fortis: ‘spirited.’—equus: by Ennius, and also probably by

—spatio . . . supremo: ‘at the end of the course!

6 31 Olympia: cognate acc. By Ennius u would have been written

169 B.c., imposed a restrictiori on the institution of women as heirs. It
